# chrome-allow-copy-paste

Some websites block your ability to copy and paste text and content from them, this extension works to prevent these restrictions from being added.


## Development

You can work on the HTML files individually using `npm install` and `npm run dev` which will start the tailwind cli to auto-generate your css.

To deploy your app to the Chrome Web Store a zip file can be created by running `npm run build` and the output file can be found in the root directory named `chrome-allow-copy-paste.zip`.

## Design

In the design folder you can find all the assets to publish the app on the Chrome Web Store.
